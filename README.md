# Databases Final Project
### Fall 2022
## Air Ticket Reservation System
Using this system, customers can search for flights, purchase flights ticket, view their upcoming flight status or see their past flights etc. There will be three types of users of this system - Customers, Booking Agents and Airline Staff (Administrator). Booking Agents will book flights for other Customers, can get a fixed commission. They can view their monthly reports and get total commission. Airline Staff will add new airplanes, create new flights, and update flight status. In general, this will be simple air ticket reservation system.
